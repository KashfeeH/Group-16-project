# Lyric & Song
## Description 
Working in a group of four, we designed a simple web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to search for song lyrics and display them along with a corresponding YouTube video. The application utilizes Bootstrap for styling and layout, as well as Font Awesome and Bootstrap Icons for additional icons. This is a project using Jquery, Bootstrap and two-server side Apis.
