# LyricLink  

## Description
Working in a group of four, we designed a simple web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to search for song lyrics and display them along with a corresponding YouTube video. The application utilizes Bootstrap for styling and layout, as well as Font Awesome and Bootstrap Icons for additional icons. This is a project using Jquery, Bootstrap and two-server side Apis.  

## Installation
The web application does not require any installation and will run on most internet browsers. The web application is deployed at this link here and feel free to click and experience its magical works:https://kashfeeh.github.io/Group-16-project/.

To search a required video, the user types into the 'Name of Artist' followed by a hyphen into the search box and 'Name of Song' box, then clicks on the 'See Video' button. This uses the YouTube API to fetch the result.  

To search the accompanying lyrics, the user needs to delete the hyphen out of the 'Name of Artist' search box, then clicks on the 'See Lyrics' button. This uses the Lyrics.OVH API to fetch the result.
